            (including but not limited to copyright or data protection laws).
            
            A breach or violation of any of the Terms will result in an immediate termination of your Services.

            [Your Site Name] provides users with access to curated product links, 
            exclusive or early access links, affiliate links, or other digital information relating to third-party products. 
            We do not own or sell the physical products linked to, and we are not responsible for the final delivery, 
            performance, or condition of any third-party items.
            
            Use of our service grants you access to information or links and does not guarantee stock availability, 
            pricing accuracy, or purchase success on third-party platforms.

            
            SECTION 3 - BILLING AND ACCESS
            
            You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information for all purchases made via our site.
            
            We reserve the right to limit, refuse or cancel access if we suspect you have provided false information, 
            violated our terms, or engaged in misuse of the Service.
            
            Some services may be subscription-based or one-time purchases. All sales are final unless otherwise stated.

            
            SECTION 4 - MODIFICATIONS TO THE SERVICE

            We are not liable to you or any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service.

            
            SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS & LINKS
            
            Our platform is built on external product links and references to third-party websites. 
            We do not control, manage, or guarantee the accuracy, availability, or safety of those external platforms or products.
            
            Any purchase, dispute, return, or warranty issue regarding a product linked from our site must be handled directly with
