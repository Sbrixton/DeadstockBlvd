        <h3 id="refund-title">Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>
                Last updated: {add your date}
                <br>
                At DEADSTØCK, we provide a digital fashion curation and sourcing service. 
                Customers receive verified seller contact details, item information, and guidance after payment. 
                Since our service is delivered digitally and begins immediately after purchase, 
                refunds are handled according to the conditions below.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>1. Digital Service Nature</h3>
                <br>
                All payments made to DEADSTØCK are for a digital service. 
                We do not sell, handle, ship, or guarantee the condition or availability of any physical items displayed on our platform.
                Because our service is delivered instantly after payment, most purchases are <strong>non-refundable</strong>.
                
                <h3>2. When Refunds May Be Granted</h3>
                A refund may be considered only under the following circumstances:
                - If the digital service (seller details or item information) was not delivered to you.<br>
                - If you were charged in error or charged more than once.<br>
                - If the payment was made without your authorization.
                <br>
                
                <h3>3. Situations Not Eligible for Refund</h3>
                Refunds cannot be issued for the following:
                - If you change your mind after receiving the digital service.<br>
                - If you are dissatisfied with the third-party seller, item condition, or pricing.<br>
                - If the seller does not respond, delay delivery, or fails to complete a transaction.<br>
                - If the product shown by the seller differs from expectations.
                <br>
                This is because DEADSTØCK does not own, ship, verify, 
                or guarantee the items presented by third-party sellers. 
                Our responsibility ends after delivering the curated information and seller details.
                <br><br>
                
                <h3>4. Incorrect Payment Amounts</h3>
                <br>
                If you accidentally submit the wrong amount during checkout, 
                you must contact us immediately. Partial refunds may be possible 
                only if the service has not yet been delivered.
                <br><br>
                
                <h3>5. Processing Time</h3>
                <br>
                If eligible, refunds may take between 5–10 business days to reflect, 
                depending on your bank or payment provider.
                <br><br>
                
                <h3>6. Contact for Refund Requests</h3>
                <br>
                To request a refund (if eligible), email us at:<br>
                <strong>{your email}</strong><br>
                Include your name, order reference, payment date, and the reason for your request.</p>

              <br>

              <h3>SECTION 4 — BILLING & ACCOUNT ACCURACY</h3>
              <br>
              You agree to provide complete and accurate information during checkout. Transactions may be 
              canceled if billing details appear invalid, incomplete, or fraudulent.
              <br>
              We reserve the right to refuse service, cancel orders, or restrict access if fraudulent, harmful,

                    <br>
                    Welcome to DEADSTØCK. These Terms of Service (“Terms”, “Agreement”) govern your use of our website, digital services, and any related tools or content provided by DEADSTØCK (“we”, “us”, “our”).<br>
                    By accessing or using our platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms in full.
                    <br><br>
                    If you do not agree, you may not access or use any part of the website or its services.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>SECTION 1 — OVERVIEW</h3>
                    <br>
                    DEADSTØCK operates as a digital platform offering curated information, sourcing assistance, and access to product-related links. We do not produce, hold, handle, or ship physical goods.
                    <br>
                    Our role is strictly digital. We provide informational resources and curated access to third-party sellers or manufacturers. We do not guarantee product availability, pricing accuracy, or successful purchases on external websites.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>SECTION 2 — ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h3>
                    <br>
                    By using the website, placing an order, or accessing our digital services, you confirm that you:<br>
                    - Are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction<br>
                    - Have read and agree to these Terms<br>
                    - Will comply with all applicable laws and platform policies
                    <br>
                    If you disagree with any part of the Terms, you must discontinue use of the website and services.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>SECTION 3 — NATURE OF SERVICES</h3>
                    <br>
                    We provide digital goods, including curated links, sourcing information, and manufacturer/retailer access. We are not the seller or distributor of the physical products displayed on our site.
                    <br>
                    Because our services provide immediate, digital access, product listings may change, be updated, or be removed without notice. We do not guarantee the accuracy of product details, pricing, or availability on third-party platforms.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>SECTION 4 — BILLING, PAYMENTS & ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h3>
                    <br>
                    You agree to provide accurate and complete billing information when making any purchase on our site.
                    <br>
                    Payments are processed securely by third-party payment processors. DEADSTØCK does not store full payment card details.
                    <br>
                    We reserve the right to:<br>
                    - Cancel or refuse any order at our discretion<br>
                    - Limit purchases per customer, account, or payment method<br>
                    - Restrict access if fraud or misuse is suspected
                    <br>
                    
                    Suspicious, duplicate, or unauthorized activity may result in permanent account restrictions.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>SECTION 5 — DIGITAL GOODS & REFUND POLICY</h3>
                    <br>
                    All purchases made through DEADSTØCK are **final sale**. We do not provide refunds, returns, or exchanges once digital access has been delivered.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Because our services are digital and accessible immediately after purchase, they cannot be returned or revoked. This policy prevents misuse, unauthorized access, and fraudulent retrieval of digital content.
                    <br>
                    Chargebacks or payment disputes filed after digital delivery may result in suspension of access to the platform while the matter is reviewed.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>SECTION 6 — FRAUD, MISUSE & ACCOUNT TERMINATION</h3>
                    <br>
                    We may monitor platform activity to protect against fraud and abuse. Misuse includes, but is not limited to:<br>
                    - Sharing or reselling digital access<br>
                    - Using false identities<br>
                    - Attempting unauthorized refunds or disputes<br>

                    <br><br>
                    <h3>SECTION 7 — THIRD-PARTY LINKS & PRODUCTS</h3>
                    <br>
                    Our services may include links to third-party retailers, sellers, or websites. These platforms are not owned, controlled, or operated by us.
                    <br><br>

                    - Accuracy of information on external websites<br>
                    - Shipping, delivery, or returns for third-party products<br>
                    - Transactions made on external websites<br>
                    - How third-party platforms handle your data
                    <br><br>
                    Users must review each third party’s policies before completing a purchase.
