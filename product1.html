      <p>
        <h4>SECTION X - NO REFUND POLICY</h4>
        <br>
        By purchasing from DeadstockBlvd, you acknowledge that all sales are final. 
        We do not offer refunds, exchanges, or cancellations — under any circumstances.
        <br></br>
        
        This website operates as a third-party platform providing access to **digital goods, information, and manufacturer product links**. 
        We are not the original seller or manufacturer of any physical product referenced on this site.
        <br></br>
        
        You are paying for access to a **digital resource**, **tool**, or **curated link** — not the physical product itself. 
        We do not ship, store, or process physical inventory.
        <br></br>
        
        Once digital access is granted, your purchase is considered complete and fulfilled. 
        Digital products cannot be returned or revoked — and attempting to refund would be unethical and subject to abuse.
        <br></br>
        
        We enforce a **strict no-refund policy** for the following reasons:
        <br>
        - Delivery is immediate and irreversible upon purchase<br>
        - The service is informational and digital in nature<br>
        - You gain access to proprietary or exclusive content instantly<br>
        - We have no way to “un-send” or “take back” digital items<br></br>
        
        Disputing charges or filing payment claims after receiving access will result in:
        <br>
        - Immediate account termination<br>
        - Permanent IP ban from our platform<br>
        - Possible legal action depending on the severity of the case<br></br>
        
        By continuing to use this site and placing an order, you accept and agree to these terms in full.

        <br></br>
        Ensure your personal and payment details are accurate. Failing to follow these Terms 
        may result in refusal of service, temporary suspension, or permanent account bans.

        By placing an order, you acknowledge and agree to DeadstockBlvd’s Terms of Service, including but not limited to:

        <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
        <br></br>
        This website is operated by DeadstockBlvd. 
        Throughout the site, the terms “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to DeadstockBlvd. 
        We provide this website and all its digital content, services, and tools to you, the user, conditioned upon your acceptance 
        of all terms, conditions, policies, and notices outlined here.
        <br></br>
        By visiting this site and/or purchasing any digital service or access product, 
        you are engaging with our “Service” and agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”), 
        including additional terms linked or referenced on this page. 
        These Terms apply to ALL users — including browsers, purchasers, contributors, and affiliates.
        <br></br>
        Please read these Terms carefully. If you do not agree, do not use the website or access any services. 
        Continuing to browse or purchase will be considered legal acceptance.
        <br></br>
        We reserve the right to update or change these Terms at any time by posting revisions here. 
        It is your responsibility to review changes. Continued use of the site after updates constitutes your acceptance.
        <br></br>
        All services and digital products are final sale. No returns. No refunds. No exceptions. 
        We operate as a sourcing and informational platform — not a traditional e-commerce retailer.
        <br></br>
        We (“the brand”) will not be liable for any oversight, failure to read our policies, or incorrect expectations.
        You are responsible for understanding our digital nature and structure.
        <br><br>
        
        <h4>SECTION 1 <br>- USE OF THE SITE</h4>
        <br></br>
        By using this site, you confirm that you are at least the legal age of majority in your region. 
        If you are under that age, you may not use the site without the supervision and permission of a legal guardian.
        <br></br>
        You agree not to use our site for any unlawful purposes or to break any applicable laws, including data or copyright laws.
        <br></br>
        Violation of these Terms will result in immediate and permanent termination of access.
        
        <br></br>
        <h4>SECTION 2 <br>- DIGITAL GOODS & REFUND POLICY</h4>
        <br></br>
        We provide access to curated links, exclusive info, and digital products ONLY. We do not physically hold, ship, or sell 
        the products linked on our platform.
        <br></br>
        **All sales are final.** We DO NOT support refunds or exchanges — and we explain that transparently:
        Because we only sell access to digital goods or information, any transaction is instantly fulfilled the moment access is granted.
        <br></br>
        Once digital content is delivered or accessed, it cannot be “returned.” There is no ethical way to refund digital goods 
        without enabling exploitation, theft, or misuse of our system. 
        <br></br>
        By purchasing, you agree to this policy. Attempting to force chargebacks or dispute digital access will result in an 
        instant account ban and permanent blacklist from the site.
        <br></br>
        **We do not support reselling of our digital products.** Unauthorized resale, redistribution, or duplication of access links 
        or tools violates our terms and may result in legal consequences.
        
        <br></br>
        <h4>SECTION 3 <br>- BILLING, FRAUD, & ACCESS</h4>
        <br>
        You agree to provide complete, current, and accurate billing details during any purchase. 
        Any inconsistencies may lead to automatic cancellation.
        <br>
        If we suspect fraud, misuse, false identity, or any ill intent, we reserve the right to:
        <br>
        - Cancel your order<br>
        - Block your IP<br>
        - Permanently ban your account<br>
        - Report you to payment providers and legal authorities<br>
        <br>
        Attempts to bypass bans, share internal access, or exploit the system will be handled seriously.
        This includes duplicate accounts or using VPNs to mask fraudulent behavior.
        <br></br>
        
        <h4>SECTION 4 <br>- OFFICIAL COMMUNICATION & CONTACT</h4>
        <br>
        We are NOT affiliated with any other websites, social platforms, or resellers.
        DeadstockBlvd operates solely through this domain. Any other source claiming to represent us is fraudulent.
        <br></br>
        If you need assistance, have a concern, or require clarification, you must contact us through the official method:
        <br></br>
        Submit an inquiry via our **Contact Page**, including your **full name**, **order ID or product accessed**, 
        and a clear description of your issue or question. 
        <br>
        Failure to include this information may result in delays or no response.
        <br></br>
        
        <h4>SECTION 5 <br>- AGREEMENT BY CHECKOUT</h4>
        <br>
        By clicking “checkout” or submitting payment on any product page, you confirm that:

        - You accept all refund, billing, and access policies<br>
        - You are responsible for your decision to proceed<br>
        <br>
        We include a mandatory checkbox confirming your agreement. 
        If you bypass this checkbox, disable scripts, or skip through the checkout in any way — we are **not liable** for your 
        lack of awareness. Your ignorance does not equal our accountability.
        <br></br>
        Purchases made without reading or acknowledging our Terms are still subject to them in full.
        
        <br></br>
        <h4>SECTION 6 <br> - GENERAL DISCLAIMERS</h4>
        <br>
        We do not guarantee success on any linked third-party website, product availability, or price accuracy. 
        We simply provide verified access — it’s on you to use it wisely.
        <br>
        We are not responsible for:
        <br>
        - Changes made by third-party sellers<br>
        - Site downtime<br>
        - Payment issues caused by your provider<br>
        - Misinterpretation of product descriptions<br>
        <br>
        Use the platform at your own discretion.
        <br></br>
        
        <h4>SECTION 7 <br> - TERMINATION OF SERVICE</h4>
        <br>
        We reserve the right to terminate your access or cancel orders at any time if you:
        <br>
        - Break the rules<br>
        - Attempt fraud<br>
        - Harass staff<br>
        - Misuse the system<br>
        - Create duplicates or fake accounts<br>
        <br>
        Termination decisions are final and not subject to appeal.
        
        <br></br>
        <h4>SECTION 8 <br> - GOVERNING LAW</h4>
        <br>
        These Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with UK law.
        <br>

        <br></br>

          <h4>TERMS OF SERVICE</h4>
          <br>  
          Welcome to DeadstockBlvd. These Terms of Service (“Terms”, “Agreement”) govern your use of our website, 
          digital services, and any related content or tools provided by DeadstockBlvd (“we”, “us”, “our”). 
          By accessing or using our platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms in full.
          <br></br>
          Please read carefully before proceeding. If you do not agree, you may not access or use any part of the website or its services.
          <br></br>

          <h4>SECTION 1 - OVERVIEW</h4>
          <br>
          DeadstockBlvd operates as a third-party platform offering digital products, information, and manufacturer-related content. 
          We do not produce, handle, or ship physical products. Our primary function is to provide informational and digital resources 
          linked to legitimate product sources and manufacturers.
          <br></br>
          By visiting our website or purchasing a digital product, you agree that your relationship with us is strictly digital in nature. 
          We do not guarantee product stock, price accuracy, or purchase success on external websites or third-party retailers.
          <br></br>

          <h4>SECTION 2 - ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h4>
          <br>
          By using the website, making a purchase, or accessing our content, you confirm that you:
          <br>
          - Are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction<br>
          - Have read, understood, and accepted these Terms<br>
          - Agree to comply with all applicable laws and site policies<br></br>
  
          If you disagree with any portion of these Terms, you must not use the Service.

          <br></br>

          <h4>SECTION 3 - NATURE OF THE SERVICE</h4>
          <br>
          DeadstockBlvd provides users access to curated links, manufacturer information, early access links, 
          and other digital content. We are **not** the manufacturer, seller, or shipper of physical goods. 
          We act as a **third-party digital distributor** for informational and sourcing purposes only.
          <br></br>
          All products or links displayed are subject to change, removal, or modification without notice. 
          We make every effort to ensure accuracy but cannot guarantee the correctness of product descriptions, prices, or availability.
          <br></br>
      
          <h4>SECTION 4 - BILLING, PAYMENTS & ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h4>
          <br>
          You agree to provide complete and accurate billing details for all transactions. 
          All payments are securely processed through trusted third-party gateways. We do not store full payment information.
          <br></br>
          We reserve the right to:
          <br>
          - Refuse or cancel any order at our discretion<br>
          - Limit quantities purchased per person, account, or payment method<br>
          - Deny access to users suspected of fraudulent activity or violations of these Terms<br></br>
          Any suspicious, duplicate, or unauthorized purchases may result in an immediate account ban.
          <br></br>

          <h4>SECTION 5 - NO REFUND POLICY</h4>
          <br>
          All purchases made through DeadstockBlvd are **final sale**. 
          We do not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges under any circumstances.
          <br></br>
          This policy exists because all services provided are **digital and informational in nature** — 
          delivery occurs instantly upon purchase. Once digital access or content is delivered, it cannot be revoked or “returned.”
          <br></br>
          Refunding digital goods would be unethical and open to exploitation. 
          We take this policy seriously to maintain fairness and security across all users.
          <br></br>
          Any chargeback or payment dispute filed after receiving access will result in:
          <br>
          - Permanent termination of your account<br>
          - IP bans from the site<br>
          - Possible legal escalation or reporting to payment processors<br></br>
          By purchasing from DeadstockBlvd, you acknowledge that all transactions are final and non-refundable.

          <br></br>

          <h4>SECTION 6 - FRAUD, MISUSE, AND ACCOUNT TERMINATION</h4>
          <br>
          We reserve the right to monitor user activity for fraudulent or abusive behavior. 
          Any suspicion of misuse, such as sharing access links, duplicating digital goods, or attempting chargebacks, 
           will result in an immediate ban without notice.
          <br></br>
          Fraudulent users may be reported to relevant authorities or payment processors. 
          We maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward abuse, scamming, or resale of our digital goods.
          <br></br>

          <h4>SECTION 7 - THIRD-PARTY LINKS & PRODUCTS</h4>
          <br>
          Our services may include links to third-party websites or manufacturers. 
          These external platforms are not operated or controlled by us.
          <br></br>
          We are not responsible for:
          <br>
          - Content accuracy on third-party sites<br>
          - Shipping, refunds, or returns from external sellers<br>
          - Data collection practices of other websites<br></br>
          Users must review each third party’s policies before making purchases or sharing personal data.  
  
          <br></br>

        <h4>SECTION 8 - USER CONDUCT</h4>

        - Redistributing or reselling our digital content<br>
        - Misrepresenting your affiliation with DeadstockBlvd<br></br>
        Any breach of these rules will result in immediate account termination and possible legal action.

        <br></br>

        <h4>SECTION 9 - DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h4>
        <br>
        The services and all content provided are delivered “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind. 
        We make no guarantees that access will be uninterrupted, error-free, or continuously available.
        <br></br>
